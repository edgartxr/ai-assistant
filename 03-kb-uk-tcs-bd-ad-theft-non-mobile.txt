We have designed this cover for people who:
    • bought a product from the Amazon UK website.
    • do not already have an insurance policy to cover that product.
    • want to cover against the cost of repairing or replacing it should it be accidentally damaged, breaks down or is stolen.

You are eligible for this cover if:
    • The product you have bought was new or Amazon Renewed.
    • You are a UK resident (excluding Channel Islands and Isle of Man).

This policy covers a single, eligible product.

Your product is covered anywhere in the world for:
    • Damage
    • Breakdown.
    • Theft

[Title level 2: For products less than £150]

If your product is damaged, breaks down or is stolen, we will provide an Amazon Gift Card claim code (or alternative selected by us) to the value of a replacement product. If such a product is not available, we will decide the Gift Card claim code value based on the price you originally paid for the product.

[Title level 2: For products £150 or more]

If your product is stolen, we will replace it.
If your product is damaged or breaks down, we will either repair or replace it. The decision to repair or replace will be made by us. Repairs will be done using original equipment manufacturer parts or manufacturer equivalent parts. Any repairs we do will come with a 6-month guarantee. If your product has a recurring fault for the same reason and requires a 3rd repair, we will replace the product.
Replacements
If we provide a replacement product you will have the choice of either:
    a) A replacement product that is:
-A product of the same or comparable brand
-Has equivalent technical specification (as determined by us).
-Is sold as new by Amazon via amazon.co.uk on the day of settlement. Your replacement product will be new and will have a new manufacturer guarantee; or
    b) An Amazon Gift Card claim code (or alternative selected by us) to the value of a replacement product. If such a product is not available, we will determine the Gift Card claim code value based on the price which you originally paid for the product.

Whether you select (a) or (b) your policy will end. If you chose option (a) we can arrange for collection of broken heavy kitchen appliances or TVs. If you choose option (b) you become responsible for disposing of your broken product. We will cover up to £50 towards any costs to dispose of the broken product. We will need a formal company invoice or receipt to cover these costs.

[Title level 2: For all products]

There is no excess to pay on any claims.
If you cannot provide the damaged or faulty product to support your claim, we will class it as being lost and not covered by this policy.
Any products replaced by us will become our property if we ask for it to be returned to us.

[Title level 2: Re-installation costs]

If the replacement product we provide needs professional installation, we will cover up to £50 towards installation. This covers things like electrical wiring, plumbing or gas fitting. We will need a formal company invoice or receipt before we can settle these costs.

[Title level 1: What you are not covered for / Policy exclusions]

[Title level 2: Damage, breakdown or theft because of improper use or not taking reasonable care of your product]

We expect that you will take care of your product, if you do not, then we may decline your claim.
Taking care of your product means –
    • Following manufacturer instructions on using your product
    • Not using your product in an environment which could materially increase the risk of damage to it. For example, taking a non-waterproof product with you whilst swimming
    • Not intentionally damaging your product
    • Not knowingly leaving your product somewhere it is likely to be stolen or damaged, just think would you leave your wallet or purse there?
    • If you need to leave your gadget somewhere then we expect you to lock it away out of sight if possible. If you cannot lock it away, then you must leave it with someone you trust or concealed out of sight in a safe place.
If you knowingly leave your product somewhere you can’t see it, but others can, we may decline your claim for not taking care – for example:
    • In a cafe or pub you leave your product on the table when you go to the bar to pick up your drink instead of taking it with you
    • Leaving your product on display in your car
    • Leaving your product in the care of someone you don’t know well
    • If you are at the gym and you leave your product on a bench in the changing rooms rather than taking it with you or locking it in a locker

The examples increase the risk of it being stolen or damaged and may result in your claim being declined. The examples are to help you understand what’s covered and are not the only reasons a claim could be rejected.

Improper use of your product is where the product is used outside of the manufacturer instructions. Not taking care increases the risk of it being damaged and may result in us declining your claim. The examples are to help you understand what is covered.

We will always consider the situation when the incident occurred when assessing your claim.

[Title level 2: Loss]

This policy does not cover your product being lost.

[Title level 2: More than 3 repairs in a 12- month period]

If your product needs repairing, we will only provide up to 3 repairs in any 12-month period.

We will cancel this policy if a 3rd repair is completed within any 12-month period. For example, the 1st repair is completed on 1st January and 2nd repair is completed on 1st May, if the 3rd repair is needed before 1st January the following year, then the policy will end immediately.

[Title level 2: Cosmetic Damage]

We will not repair or replace your product if it gets a scratch or dent on it and still works as expected.

[Title level 2: Accessories]

Accessories that didn’t come with the product when it was purchased are not covered.

[Title level 2: Contents of your product]

We don’t cover the contents of your product such as photos or contacts. This also means we do not cover any financial losses if any of the information stored on your product is used to access any existing accounts or open new accounts fraudulently.

This also includes any repair or modification which has not been authorised by the manufacturer.

[Title level 2: Viruses and software]

Breakdown due to malicious software, software faults or updates is not covered.

[Title level 2: Manufacturer guarantee]

This policy does not cover any costs covered under the manufacturer guarantee. It also doesn’t cover any faults which relate to a manufacturer recall of your product.

    • Managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities.
    • Checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance.
